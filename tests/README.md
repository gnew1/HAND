# HAND Tests

This directory contains tests for the HAND programming model.

## Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests
├── examples/       # Tests for example code
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Running Tests

(Test execution instructions will be added based on the implementation language)

## Writing Tests

When writing tests:

1. Test one thing at a time
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. Include both positive and negative test cases
5. Test edge cases

## Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage:
- Core functionality: 100%
- Extensions: 80%+
- Examples: As needed

## Continuous Integration

(CI configuration will be added)

## Contributing Tests

All code contributions should include appropriate tests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests
Test individual functions and modules in isolation.

### Integration Tests
Test how components work together.

### Example Tests
Verify that examples work as documented.

## Best Practices

- Keep tests simple and focused
- Make tests independent
- Use meaningful assertions
- Document complex test scenarios
- Maintain tests as code evolves

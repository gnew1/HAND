# Deterministic Translation (CNL) — HAND v0.1

## Goal

Allow authors to write human-facing explanations in any natural language **without changing the executable code**.

This keeps the HAND lexical layer stable and preserves *determinism, auditability, and conformance testing* across locales.

## Normative rule

A translated `.hand` file is valid **iff**:

- **CODE is identical** between base and candidate, and
- only the following MAY change:
  1) the body of the `📋 DESCRIPCIÓN:` block (indented lines under the header), and
  2) string literals explicitly marked translatable with the 🌐 marker.

Everything else MUST remain unchanged:
- keywords (`show`, `if`, `while`, …)
- identifiers
- operators / punctuation
- numbers
- emojis used as semantic tokens
- indentation structure / block layout

## `📋 DESCRIPCIÓN:` block

Definition:
- starts at a line whose `strip()` equals `📋 DESCRIPCIÓN:`
- includes subsequent lines that are:
  - blank, or
  - indented with **>= 4 spaces**
- ends at first non-empty line that is not indented.

The header line `📋 DESCRIPCIÓN:` is part of **CODE** and MUST remain canonical.

## Marked translatable literals

A string literal token is translatable only if immediately preceded (ignoring newlines) by the canonical marker emoji:

- marker: `🌐`

Example:

```hand
show 🌐 "Hola"
```

Allowed change:

```hand
show 🌐 "Hello"
```

Unmarked strings MUST NOT change.

## Tool: `transliterate.py`

This repository ships a validator:

```bash
python transliterate.py --base base.hand --candidate es.hand
```

Exit codes:
- `0` OK
- `2` invalid translation (prints first violation)

Implementation note:
- The HAND v0.1 lexer is strict; the validator *masks* DESCRIPTION-body lines to lexable placeholders before token comparison.
  This does **not** weaken the rule, because DESCRIPTION is explicitly non-code.

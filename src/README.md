The HAND framework is designed to be language-agnostic. This directory will contain:

- Core model implementations
- Base classes/interfaces
- Common utilities
- Extension mechanisms

## Development

When adding new source files:

1. Follow the existing directory structure
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Include tests for new functionality
4. Update this README if adding new modules

## Modules

### Core
Foundation components of the HAND model.

### Extensions
Framework for extending HAND with custom functionality.

### Utils
Common utilities used throughout the framework.
